## Screensharing Discord Bot

Allow screensharing in any voice channel on Discord.

### How to use

* Create a developer app [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/).
* Make it a bot and grab it's token.
* Copy the token into the `token` variable within the file, making sure it is a string.
* Simply run the `.py` file and the bot will automatically load.

DISCLAIMER: Uses `discord.py` version 1.0.1

### Todo List

* Add custom prefix support.
* Implement an accept/deny invite feature.
* Add the ability to get the link again.
* Add the ability to invite new people who weren't in the channel originially.
* Make it so users can create private "hangout" channels.
* ~~Migrate to `discord.py` version 1.0.0~~
